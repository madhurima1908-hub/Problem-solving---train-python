prob 1: We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure time of times, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required, and no train to wait.
arr[] = 9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00
dep[] = 9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00

sample output: minimum platform required = 3

prob 2: Find the minimum number of arrows to bust balloons. Given a set of balloons each
represented by a range start, end file the minimum number of arrows required to bust all 
the ballons. An arrow can burst multiple ballons if they overlap.

sample input: {{10, 16}, {2, 8}, {1, 6}, {7, 12}}
sample output: minimum number of arrows to bust balloons = 2
